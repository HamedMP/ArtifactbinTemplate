# ArtifactBin Template Project

Welcome to the ArtifactBin template project! This repository serves as a starting point for deploying React components created on [ArtifactBin.com](https://artifactbin.com) to Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://artifactbin.com/deploy)

## Overview

This template project is designed to work seamlessly with ArtifactBin.com, allowing you to quickly deploy your React components to Vercel with just a few clicks. The project structure is set up to accommodate the React component you create on ArtifactBin.com.

## Project Structure

```
/
├── app/
│   └── page.tsx    # Your React component will be placed here
├── public/
│   └── ...         # Static assets
├── .gitignore
├── next.config.js

```

## How It Works

1. Create or edit your React component on [ArtifactBin.com](https://artifactbin.com).
